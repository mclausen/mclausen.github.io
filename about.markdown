_Me, with a cap, on a mountain, in Turkey_
{: refdef}

Software developer with striving for excellence, innovating and building smarter solutions through lean agile practices. In my relative short period as a developer i've had the chance to work as freelancher, product developer and a consultant, giving me the opportunity to work as a individual and a teamplayer and get a good sense for best practices.

Great things comes from hard work, and much of my out-of-office hours is spend in the gym, doing all sorts of crazy things from gymnastics to olympic weightlifting to enduring cardiovascular workouts. I am very much into having a healthy and balanced lifestyle, which gives me alot of energy and is a big part of my personal trait.
